# Task 1: Assembly Challenge - Analyzing `last.s`

## Overview
This challenge is part of my journey through pwn.college, where I tackle only the hardest and most interesting tasks. The goal of this task is to analyze and understand the assembly code I wrote (`last.s`) and demonstrate its functionality.

## Objectives
1. **Analyze the Code**: Understand the purpose and functionality of the assembly code.
2. **Explain the Logic**: Break down the key operations, including memory manipulation, loops, and conditional logic.
3. **Solve the Challenge**: Use the code to determine its output and verify its correctness.

## Code Highlights
The provided assembly code (`last.s`) performs the following operations:
- **Memory Initialization**: Allocates and zeroes out a 256-word buffer on the stack.
- **Input Processing**: Iterates through an input buffer, doubles each byte, and counts occurrences in the buffer.
- **Finding the Maximum**: Identifies the most frequent doubled value and its index.
- **Returning the Result**: Outputs the index of the most frequent value.

This task demonstrates low-level programming skills, including stack management, loop construction, and efficient memory operations.

## Requirements
- Strong understanding of x86-64 assembly language.
- Familiarity with debugging tools like GDB or Radare2.
- Problem-solving skills to analyze and verify the code's behavior.

## Resources
- [Intel x86-64 Assembly Language Reference](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html)
- [GDB Debugger Documentation](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/)
- [Radare2 Documentation](https://radare.org/n/)

## Submission
This task is part of my personal collection of hard challenges. The solution and analysis are documented in the `solution.md` file, along with any test cases or debugging steps used to verify the code.
